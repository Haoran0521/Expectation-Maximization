This is a simple expectation maximization problem.

In this question, we basically need to use expectation maximization to solve a 1-D exponential distribution clustering problem.

The important thing here:
1) What is the maximization for the parameters of an exponential distribution.
2) There are two different ways of explaining an exponential distribution: the parameter x represents the number of trails until success;
the parameter x represents the number of failures before success.
